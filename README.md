# Comp271Project2

**Project Abstract**

This project is based on a license plate game where the letters of a license plate (usually there are 3) are used and the players have to find words with those three letters in order. This program allows users to enter three letters and then the program looks through a dictionary and finds all the words with those 3 letters in the correct order.
